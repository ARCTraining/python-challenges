# Python Challenges

In this book are available some suggested problems to be solved with python.

*The main objective of these challenges is to assist in the development of a problem-solving logic, therefore, the use of existing functions will be avoided as much as possible.*

## Challenge Difficulty Scale

Problems are classified according to complexity using the following color scale:

- ðŸŸ¢ Beginner
- ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate
- ðŸŸ  Proficient
- ðŸ”´ Expert
<!-- - ðŸŸ¤ -->
<!-- - âš« -->

## Write and test your solutions

For each proposed problem, a `jupyter notebook` will be available so that you can write your own solution to the problem and test it.

### Working in the cloud

You can write your code in the cloud using Binder or Google Colab.

To work in the cloud, look for the launch button (ðŸš€) in the upper right corner and choose your preferred platform.

### Working locally

To work locally, first clone this GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARCTraining/python_challenges.git
cd python_challenges
```

Then, create the conda environment

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate python-challenges
```

*Note: depending on your operating system, you may need to replace `conda activate` with `source activate` in the above command.*

Finally, you can open the contents of this book using jupyter lab (included in the environment) - or any IDE of your choice.

```bash
jupyter lab
```

## Proposed Solutions

A solution is be provided for each proposed problem. The solutions are intended to prioritize **learning** over **optimization**.

*Note that each proposed solution is just one of the possible solutions for each problem.*
